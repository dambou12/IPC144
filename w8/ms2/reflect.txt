1-A function designates in programming a subroutine making it
 possible to carry out repetitive operations.the use of the function
 to factorize the code ,that is to say to offer general procedures,
shared by the program and placed at a precise place where they can 
be easily found to modify or adapt.it also obvious for all other languages 
not only the C.function make easy the general view of the code and avoids 
repetition of the codes

2-the helpers is created in another module to avoid the repetition of the
codes in the contacts module.the helpers module is not included in
the contacts module  because it will make the module contacts huge and difficult
to figure out
