 2-      the difference between DO-WHILE and WHILE is that of input ,the do-while
  first add data before checking the condition and if the condition is respected then
 it continues and if it doesn'trespect ,it leaves the loop whereas with WHILE ,
the program will not work even one time if the condition is no respected.
in other word with WHILE there is not first record if the conditin is not respected

 3-the purpose of the conditional expression is to select one of two expressions
depending on a third ,boolean,expression
